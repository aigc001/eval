# First, we need to take the natural logarithm of x
log_x = np.log(x)

# Now, we can use polyfit to fit a line to the logarithmic data
log_coeffs = np.polyfit(log_x, y, 1)

# The coefficients returned by polyfit are for the equation y = mx + c,
# where m is the first coefficient and c is the second coefficient.
# Since we took the natural logarithm of x, the first coefficient is actually A from y = Alogx + B.
# The second coefficient is B from y = Alogx + B.
A = log_coeffs[0]
B = log_coeffs[1]
